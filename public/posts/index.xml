      <title>Building a VPN Toggle for Waybar using OpenVPN for free</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Managing VPN connections on Linux shouldn&amp;rsquo;t require opening terminals and typing commands. After getting tired of manually starting and stopping OpenVPN services, I built a custom toggle script for Waybar that does it all with a single click. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works and how you can build your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using a tiling window manager with Waybar, you probably appreciate quick access to system controls. But VPN management often gets left out—you end up with some clunky system tray app or resort to terminal commands. I wanted something better: a clean status indicator in my bar, one-click toggling, and random server selection for better privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Vibecoding is Destroying Your Skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-assisted coding feels magical—until you realize you can&amp;rsquo;t debug your own code, explain your architectural decisions, or solve problems without a chatbot. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why vibecoding is setting developers up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new breed of developer emerging. They can ship features fast. Their code looks clean at first glance. They seem productive. But ask them to explain how their code works, debug an issue without AI assistance, or make architectural decisions, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see the cracks appear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why React is Ruining the Web</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;React has become the default choice for web development, but at what cost? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how the React ecosystem has led us down a path of unnecessary complexity, bloated bundles, and websites that fail basic usability standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I need to start with a confession: I&amp;rsquo;ve built dozens of production applications with React. I understand its appeal. The component model is elegant, the ecosystem is vast, and the developer experience can be quite nice. But somewhere along the way, we stopped asking whether we should use React and started assuming we must use it for everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Hugo is the Best Static Site Generator</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/post-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of wrestling with slow build times, complicated setups, and bloated frameworks, I discovered Hugo. Here&amp;rsquo;s why it stands head and shoulders above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re building websites in 2026, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of static site generators. There are dozens of options out there—Jekyll, Gatsby, Next.js, Eleventy, and many more. Each has its strengths, but after trying them all, I keep coming back to Hugo. Not out of habit, but because it genuinely solves problems that other generators simply can&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
