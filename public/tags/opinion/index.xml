      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-assisted coding feels magical—until you realize you can&amp;rsquo;t debug your own code, explain your architectural decisions, or solve problems without a chatbot. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why vibecoding is setting developers up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new breed of developer emerging. They can ship features fast. Their code looks clean at first glance. They seem productive. But ask them to explain how their code works, debug an issue without AI assistance, or make architectural decisions, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see the cracks appear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;React has become the default choice for web development, but at what cost? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how the React ecosystem has led us down a path of unnecessary complexity, bloated bundles, and websites that fail basic usability standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I need to start with a confession: I&amp;rsquo;ve built dozens of production applications with React. I understand its appeal. The component model is elegant, the ecosystem is vast, and the developer experience can be quite nice. But somewhere along the way, we stopped asking whether we should use React and started assuming we must use it for everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
