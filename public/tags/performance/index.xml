      <title>Why React is Ruining the Web</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;React has become the default choice for web development, but at what cost? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how the React ecosystem has led us down a path of unnecessary complexity, bloated bundles, and websites that fail basic usability standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I need to start with a confession: I&amp;rsquo;ve built dozens of production applications with React. I understand its appeal. The component model is elegant, the ecosystem is vast, and the developer experience can be quite nice. But somewhere along the way, we stopped asking whether we should use React and started assuming we must use it for everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Hugo is the Best Static Site Generator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of wrestling with slow build times, complicated setups, and bloated frameworks, I discovered Hugo. Here&amp;rsquo;s why it stands head and shoulders above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re building websites in 2026, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of static site generators. There are dozens of options out there—Jekyll, Gatsby, Next.js, Eleventy, and many more. Each has its strengths, but after trying them all, I keep coming back to Hugo. Not out of habit, but because it genuinely solves problems that other generators simply can&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
