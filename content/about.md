## Introduction

Hi, my name is **Nabillio Alfahrel Rifananda.** You can call me *Fahrel.* I'm a fresh graduate from **Vocational High School 5 Surakarta** with a major in **Software Engineering.** I'm currently 20 years old and actively looking for a job.

## Life

I was born on **March 3rd, 2005 in Solo, Indonesia.** I've lived my entire life in this city, and it holds a special place in my heart. Everything about Solo is just wonderful. I currently live with my grandmother. My parents separated when I was young, and custody was given to my mother. However, we don't live under the same roof because the house isn't large enough, so she had to move to a kost (small apartment) with my older brother. Despite this, she visits me regularly and provides financial support every week. I rarely see my father—the last time was about a year ago. I'm uncertain about his current whereabouts or situation.

Right now, I'm focused on becoming financially independent and securing employment without relying on help from my parents or relatives. Simply put, I really need a job.

## Education

I began elementary school around 2013 at **SDN Bayan,** a state school. However, I encountered difficulties in 3rd grade when I frequently missed classes for reasons I still don't fully understand (probably due to laziness). This led me to repeat 3rd grade after taking a one-year break. During this time, I had to transfer to **SDN Banyuagung 3** because we moved to a different neighborhood called Banyuagung. At this new school, I performed much better—I made great friends, maintained good attendance, and achieved decent final grades.

After completing elementary school, I enrolled at **SMPN 3 Surakarta** in 2019 for middle school. My first year went well until COVID-19 arrived, forcing us to study from home due to lockdown restrictions. I spent most of my middle school years learning remotely, which was disappointing since many people consider this period the peak of their school experience (though they might be exaggerating). By my final semester in 3rd grade, COVID-19 restrictions had eased enough for us to return to school with safety measures like mandatory masks. I graduated middle school successfully, though I missed out on the traditional middle school experience that previous generations enjoyed.

Next, I attended **SMKN 5 Surakarta,** a vocational high school. I chose this path over regular high school because I believed I needed to enter the workforce quickly due to my family's financial constraints. I thought vocational school would better prepare me for immediate employment (though I later realized this assumption was somewhat misguided). At this school, I selected Computer Science as my major because I had developed an interest in the field. I successfully completed my studies and graduated.

Then, I attended college at **Universitas Pignatelli Triputra** but dropped out after 2 month due to financial constraints.

## Work

My professional experience is limited to my internship at **Digimizu Digital Management,** where I worked as a Web Developer focusing primarily on school websites. During this six-month internship, I gained valuable experience and was introduced to WordPress for the first time. This powerful content management system allows for website creation without extensive coding, and I developed considerable expertise with this tool since our projects were built using WordPress.

## Certificates

The only certificates I've got are certificates I received from my internship at **Digimizu Digital Management.**

## Personal Interests

Beyond programming, I enjoy several hobbies including listening to music, watching movies, and reading books (particularly philosophical works).
